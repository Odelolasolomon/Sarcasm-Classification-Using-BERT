# Sarcasm-Classification-Using-BERT
# Sarcasm Detection Using BERT

## Project Description

This project fine-tunes Google's BERT model, which has been highly successful in NLP applications, to detect sarcastic tweets. Originally released in 2018, BERT consists of stacked encoders from the 2017 Transformer model and is pretrained on tasks like masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction. BERT has been widely used for applications such as question answering, text classification, and sentence completion.

By leveraging BERT's powerful capabilities, this project aims to create a model that accurately identifies sarcasm in tweets.

## Key Features

- **Fine-Tuning BERT**: Adapting the pretrained BERT model to detect sarcasm in Twitter data.
- **Data Manipulation**: Utilizes `pandas` and `NumPy` for data handling and preprocessing.
- **Visualization**: Employs `seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to create insightful visualizations.
- **Deep Learning**: Implements deep learning models with `Keras` and `TensorFlow`.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model using `scikit-learn` to generate a classification report.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sarcasm-detection-bert.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sarcasm-detection-bert
    ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset and preprocess it using `pandas` and `NumPy`.
2. Fine-tune the BERT model on the dataset.
3. Visualize the data using `seaborn` and `Matplotlib`.
4. Train the deep learning model using `Keras` and `TensorFlow`.
5. Evaluate the model and generate a classification report with `scikit-learn`.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of tweets labeled as sarcastic or non-sarcastic. Ensure the dataset is properly preprocessed before training the model.

## Results

The fine-tuned BERT model successfully identifies sarcastic tweets. The final classification report, generated using `scikit-learn`, provides an overview of the model's performance.
